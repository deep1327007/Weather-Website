Welcome to my Weather Website, where you can check the current weather of any location you enter.

About

I've utilized the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data, but for privacy reasons, I've removed my API key from the JavaScript file. To use the website, you'll need to insert your own API key from the OpenWeather website.

Acknowledgments

This project wouldn't have been possible without the invaluable guidance and resources from various online platforms and creators. Special thanks to:

Approach and Implementation

While the functionality remains the same, I've taken a unique approach in the implementation. For instance:

Utilized Axios for API calls.

Replaced weather condition images with Font Awesome (FA) tag icons from the HTML icon library.

Redesigned the entire theme of the website to a black-and-white aesthetic, with valuable input from ChatGPT and my personal touch.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, even though it might not have been necessary. Happy coding, and may you squash all those bugs efficiently!
